## Welcome to my first Django Project! ðŸš€

I started this project to learn Django and, as a motivation, I wanted to create something productive during the learning process. So, I chose to build a portfolio to present what I have learned and done so far.

- [24.06.2024] The basic portfolio website is built and hosted. For hosting, I chose a VPS running Ubuntu, Nginx, and Gunicorn along with Django.
